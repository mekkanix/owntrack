## Introduction

OwnTrack is a tracking protection guard, compliant with the european GDPR, designed to use a "developer-driven" approach to manage web tracking services. It provides a fully customizable way of integrating and initializing tracking services to your website, while respecting the user consent choice.

Thanks to this, it can theorically integrate with almost any tracking service, by letting the developer have full control on its tracking integration. It manages tracking services by "encapsulating" them into a global tracking guard that executes them (or not) depending on the user explicit choice.

## Demo

Soon.
