## Introduction

OwnTrack is a tracking protection guard, compliant with the european GDPR, designed to use a "developer-driven" approach to manage web tracking services. It provides a fully customizable way of integrating and initializing tracking services to your website, while respecting the user consent choice.

Thanks to this, this tool can theorically integrate with almost any tracking service, by letting the developer having full control on its tracking integration and focusing on its code logic. It manages tracking services by "encapsulating" them and queuing corresponding operations until the user accepts consent.
